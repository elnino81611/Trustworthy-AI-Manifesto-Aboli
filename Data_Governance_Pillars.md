# 5 Core Pillars of Data Governance

Data Governance fundamentally consists of 5 essential components, especially when dealing with data intended for AI model training.

## 1. Data Quality
The data intended for model training must be of **high quality, up-to-date, and consistent**. This ensures the reliability and accuracy of the resulting AI models.

## 2. Data Security
Data must be **protected from unauthorized access** and remain secure. It must be resilient against cyber threats, preventing hackers and unauthorized parties from infiltrating or compromising the data repositories.

## 3. Data Privacy
This is an **inseparable component** that must be integrated from the initial stages of data collection or creation. It must ensure **full functionality and security**, be completely **transparent and understandable to the user**, and uphold all principles of **user respect and privacy**.

## 4. Data Ownership and Accountability
This pillar clarifies **who owns the data and grants authorization** for its use, and **who is responsible for fixing errors and ensuring data consistency and uniformity**.

## 5. Data Ethics
This pillar ensures that all data activities adhere strictly to **ethical principles** and prevents any **ethical or social harm** that might result from data usage or resulting AI systems.
