**The Model Governance Checklist (10 Fundamental Steps)**

The Model Governance checklist includes **10 fundamental steps**:

1.  **Model Explainability:** Reviewing the model's results and output, and how it handles various issues. Reviewing model bias and prejudice is important at this stage.
2.  **Model Fairness Testing:** Determining the extent to which the model's output and response are fair and free of bias and discrimination.
3.  **Model Traceability Documentation (Model Lineage):** Logging the entire process of the model from start to finish, including planning, conception, and construction.
4.  **Data Drift Monitoring:** The process of detecting response algorithms in the lab environment, how the response is reached from the input data, and reviewing its patterns.
5.  **Concept Drift Response:** Reviewing the model's performance, understanding, and explanation based on the inputs and outputs we provide to the model.
6.  **Security and Code Review (Security Vetting):** Assessing vulnerability status and raising the model's security level against cyber attacks.
7.  **Model Robustness Testing (Adversarial Testing):** Providing faulty, noisy, and malicious data to the model and checking how the model reacts to it and how high its resistance is.
8.  **Rollback Plan (Emergency Fallback):** In case the new model fails, having a backup and alternative plan to immediately revert to the previous model and not lose both simultaneously.
9.  **Owner and Responsible Party Sign-off (Accountability):** Formal approval by the designated owner and responsible party.
10. **User Privacy Approvals and Compliance:** Confirming user privacy approvals and compliance with related regulations.
